  <h2>Calling a Contract Held Elsewhere</h2>
  <p>
    We could have call a contract hold on the same account, but that 
    disturb the contract's state. 
    In any case, because it's not easy to delete state and re-create 
    account for a child of testnet or near, we choose to hold contract
    that requires state on a further sub-account, which we can easily
    delete and recreate the account if anything fails during migration. 
    As for the web4 page; as something like 
    <strong>sub-account.account.testnet.page</strong> fails when we try to 
    visit that page (due to some HSTS error), we have to hold it on account.testnet.page instead.
