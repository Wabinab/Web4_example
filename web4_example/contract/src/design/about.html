    <h2>Calling a Contract Held Elsewhere</h2>
    <p>
      We could have call a contract hold on the same account, but that 
      disturb the contract's state. 
      In any case, because it's not easy to delete state and re-create 
      account for a child of testnet or near, we choose to hold contract
      that requires state on a further sub-account, which we can easily
      delete and recreate the account if anything fails during migration. 
      As for the web4 page; as something like 
      <strong>sub-account.account.testnet.page</strong> fails when we try to 
      visit that page (due to some HSTS error), we have to hold it on account.testnet.page instead.
